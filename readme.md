# Data Science Methodology

This is a Node.js script (`data-science-methodology.js`) that provides a demonstration of the steps involved in a data science methodology. It defines an object that represents the steps of the methodology, with each step as a key and a brief description as the corresponding value.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org

2. Download or clone the `data-science-methodology.js` file to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `data-science-methodology.js` file is located.

4. Run the following command to execute the script:

   ```
   node data-science-methodology.js
   ```

   The script will output each step of the data science methodology along with its description.

## Methodology Steps

The script defines an object called `methodologySteps`, which represents the steps of the data science methodology. Each step is a key in the object, and its corresponding value is a brief description of the step.

Here are the steps included in the `methodologySteps` object:

1. **Business Understanding**: Outlines the project's intentions and goals.
2. **Data Understanding**: Involves collecting and understanding the data required for the project.
3. **Data Preparation**: Transforms the collected data into a usable form.
4. **Modeling**: Expresses the data through appropriate models to gain insights and knowledge.
5. **Evaluation**: Tests the selected model to assess its effectiveness.
6. **Deployment**: Applies the model to new data and uses it in real-world scenarios.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the `methodologySteps` object in the `data-science-methodology.js` file to include additional steps or update the descriptions as per your specific data science methodology.
